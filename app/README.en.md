## Install the application on an Android computer

As long as the application is not available via Google Play Store, you will have to use the "Developer" mode of Android to load the application directly.

### Switch the workstation to developer mode

You have to go to the system settings, then in the "About" or "Device Info", type 10 times on "Build Number", the system should display a message indicating that you have switched to developer mode.

### Fetch the APK of the application

The latest version of the APK is currently here:
[latest version ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cToGbZd3wZ49ZU1cTHJ8dAAtLZSSz_Xb?usp=sharing)
 
Just click the APK and the station will download it and then offer to install it.

At startup, the application does not have sufficient rights to use the USB port or the GPS. Users must be authorized otherwise the application will not work.
